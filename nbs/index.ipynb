    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "DiffPaSS is a family of high-performance and scalable PyTorch modules for finding optimal one-to-one pairings between two collections of biological sequences, and for performing general graph alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pairing multiple-sequence alignments (MSAs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of the problem DiffPaSS is designed to solve is the following: given two multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) A and B, containing interacting biological sequences, find the optimal one-to-one pairing between the sequences in A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](media/MSA_pairing_problem.svg)\n",
    "*Pairing problem for two multiple sequence alignments, where pairings are restricted to be within the same species*\n",
    "\n",
    "To find an optimal pairing, we can maximize the average mutual information between columns of the two paired MSAs (`InformationPairing`), or we can maximize the similarity between distance-based (`MirrortreePairing`) or orthology (`BestHitsPairing`) networks constructed from the two MSAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph alignment and pairing unaligned sequence collections\n",
    "\n",
    "DiffPaSS can be used for general graph alignment problems (`GraphAlignment`), where the goal is to find the one-to-one pairing between the nodes of two weighted graphs that maximizes the similarity between the two graphs. The user can specify the (dis-)similarity measure to be optimized, as an arbitrary differentiable function of the adjacency matrices of the two graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this capability, DiffPaSS can be used for finding the optimal one-to-one pairing between two unaligned collections of sequences, if weighted graphs are built in advance from the two collections (for example, using the pairwise Levenshtein distance). This is useful when alignments are not available or reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can I pair two collections with a different number of sequences?\n",
    "\n",
    "DiffPaSS optimizes and returns permutation matrices. Hence, its inputs are required to have the same number of sequences. However, DiffPaSS can be used to pair two collections (e.g. MSAs) containing a different number of sequences, by padding the smaller collection with dummy sequences. For multiple sequence alignments, a simple choice is to add dummy sequences consisting entirely of gap symbols. For general graphs, dummy nodes, connected to the other nodes with arbitrary edge weights, can be added to the smaller graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DiffPaSS works: soft scores, differentiable optimization, bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Check [our paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=n5hO5seROB) for details of the DiffPaSS and DiffPaSS-IPA algorithms. Briefly, the main ingredients are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Using \"soft\" scores that differentiably extend information-theoretic scores between two paired multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), or scores based on sequence similarity or graph similarity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. The (truncated) Sinkhorn operator for smoothly parametrizing \"soft permutations\", and the matching operator for parametrizing real permutations [[Mena et al, 2018]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byt3oJ-0W).\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. A novel and efficient bootstrap technique, motivated by mathematical results and heuristic insights into this smooth optimization process. See the animation below for an illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. A notion of \"robust pairs\" that can be used to identify pairs that are consistently found throughout a DiffPaSS bootstrap. These pairs can be used as ground truths in another DiffPaSS run, giving rise to the DiffPaSS-Iterative Pairing Algorithm (DiffPaSS-IPA).\n",
